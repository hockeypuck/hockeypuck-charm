# Overview

Hockeypuck is a public key server, which functions as a directory service
for OpenPGP keys. This charm can be used to deploy a standalone keyserver or a
synchronizing pool.

# Installation

To deploy this charm you will need at a minimum: a cloud environment, working
Juju installation and a successful bootstrap. Once bootstrapped, deploy this
Hockeypuck charm with:

 $ juju deploy hockeypuck

Hockeypuck requires a PostgreSQL database:

 $ juju deploy postgresql
 $ juju add-relation hockeypuck postgresql:db

Hockeypuck can cluster with other Hockeypuck peers:

 $ juju add-unit hockeypuck
 $ juju add-relation hockeypuck/0 hockeypuck/1

Or peer with the SKS charm through the gossip/peer relation:

 $ juju deploy sks
 $ juju add-relation hockeypuck:peer sks:gossip

The 'gossip' and 'peer' relations are identical for these charms. This has
the same effect:

 $ juju add-relation hockeypuck:gossip sks:peer

Expose the Hockeypuck keyserver with:

juju expose hockeypuck
